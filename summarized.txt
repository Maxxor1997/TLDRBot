WASHINGTON â€” The White House indicated on Sunday that President Trump would accept new legislation imposing sanctions on Russia and curtailing his authority to lift them on his own, a striking turnaround after a broad revolt in Congress by lawmakers of both parties who distrusted his friendly approach to Moscow and sought to tie his hands.
----------
Congressional leaders said Saturday that they had reached agreement on legislation intended to punish Russia for its interference in last year's presidential election and its aggression toward its neighbors, despite objections raised by the administration that it would inappropriately infringe on the president's ability to direct foreign policy.
----------
"The administration is supportive of being tough on Russia, particularly in putting these sanctions in place," Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was promoted to press secretary on Friday, said on "This Week" on ABC News.
----------
Administration officials said that Mr. Trump supported the array of sanctions that have already been imposed on Russia over the last three years since its annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine.
----------
But aides prepared a plan in the early days of his administration to reverse some sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama in his final weeks in office in retaliation for Russia's meddling in the election.
----------
The stand-down on the sanctions fight came at the start of a week in which the president's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr.; his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner; and his former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, are all set to talk with congressional investigators.
